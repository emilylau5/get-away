# Safe Travels 
### *A Travel App With Your Safety In Mind*

### About the App
Safe Travels is a next-generation travel app intended for safety-conscious travelers - eg. parents travelling with children, tourists wanting to know places to avoid that will compromise their safety or personal property.

### Motivation 
Our team's motivation was to create an app that's unique, useful and in a way change how people travel. A typical travel app/site concentrates only on scheduling/booking flights, hotel reservations and car rentals. Our travel app provides the user the ability to make better decisions when it comes to choosing where to stay and places to visit by displaying on a heat map representing places where crimes rates are high.
