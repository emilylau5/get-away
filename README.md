# Safe Travels

## What is it?
Safe Travels is a full-stack application intended to keep travelers as safe as possible!
Users first search a city, then Safe Travels outputs a Google heat-map of crime within the city and pins for every hotel. 
Through Safe Travels, users can make smart decisions about which hotel they intend on staying at.

## Motivation
We were motivated to create this app because we wanted people to have peace of mind while traveling to new places.
